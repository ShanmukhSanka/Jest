Design a clean, enterprise-grade web marketplace UI that exactly matches the layout and visual style of the reference image.

The page layout must consist of:
	•	A floating search and filters panel on the left
	•	A 2-column grid of cards on the right

Search & Filters panel requirements:
	•	The panel is not a full-height sidebar or navbar
	•	It appears as a floating card with a white background
	•	Subtle rounded corners and a soft shadow
	•	Positioned with padding from the page edges, visually detached from the background
	•	Contains:
	•	A search input at the top
	•	Vertically stacked filter sections (Category, Vendor, Capabilities)
	•	Minimal dropdown controls with light borders
	•	A “Clear Filters” action at the bottom

Grid & cards requirements:
	•	Exactly two cards per row, same width and same height
	•	Cards must be visually identical in design and structure
	•	White background, rounded corners, and subtle enterprise-style shadow
	•	Internal layout: title → tag chips → short description → “Learn more” link
	•	Consistent padding, typography, and spacing across all cards

Overall design constraints:
	•	Neutral enterprise color palette (white, light gray, muted accents)
	•	Professional SaaS look, similar to internal developer marketplaces
	•	Desktop-first layout
	•	No animations, no decorative illustrations, no experimental UI elements
	•	Do not introduce new layouts, components, or visual styles

Replicate the grid structure, card proportions, shadows, spacing, and floating filter panel behavior exactly, changing only text content if required.
