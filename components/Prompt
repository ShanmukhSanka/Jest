Design a clean, enterprise-grade top navigation bar exactly like the reference image.

White background, no shadows or gradients, subtle 1px light-gray bottom border. Height around 64px. Use a modern sans-serif font.

Left side: company logo, immediately followed by the text “AI Platform” in smaller, medium-weight muted dark gray text.

Center: horizontally centered navigation links — “Capabilities”, “Marketplace”, “Developer Resources” — evenly spaced, medium weight, dark gray.

Right side: right-aligned text links — “Request Access”, “Contact Us” — same font size and weight as the center links.

All links are plain text (no buttons, no hamburger menu), vertically centered, minimal hover effect (slight color darkening or underline).

Keep layout flat, minimal, professional, and enterprise-style with generous whitespace.
