Update the selected (active) card state so that the entire card container is visually highlighted, not just the inner content.

Requirements:
	•	The full card bounding box must receive the selected state
	•	No part of the highlight, border, glow, or background should be clipped at the top or sides
	•	Selected state must respect the card’s rounded corners
	•	Ensure the card’s hover / active elevation expands outward, not inward

Selected Card Styling:
	•	Apply a full-card border or outline (1–2px) around the entire card
	•	Optional subtle glow or shadow outside the card (not inside)
	•	Slight elevation increase compared to non-selected cards
	•	Background tint or accent should fill the entire card surface

Layout Constraints:
	•	Parent container must allow overflow visibility
	•	No overflow: hidden should clip the selected card’s top border or glow
	•	Spacing between cards should account for active-state elevation

Behavior:
	•	Selected card should feel like a single, complete box
	•	No visual truncation at the top
	•	Works consistently across hover, focus, and selected states

Overall Look:
	•	Enterprise-grade, clean, cloud-console style (AWS / Azure-like)
	•	Selection should be obvious but not loud
